          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            A #1 branded Rx drug was planning to stop sales because a generic
            version of their drug was coming onto the market at a lower cost to
            patients. Before this happened, they contacted Adfire Health to see
            their options. Their goal was to increase the number of actions
            taken on a gated website and deliver more patient samples and copy
            savings card to prescribing healthcare professionals.

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Adfire Health developed an effective, efficient and scalable digital
            advertising solution by:
          </p>
          <h3>
            Utilizing our proprietary database to reach healthcare
            professionals:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Adfire Health has devoted its business to building the most accurate
            and clean database of healthcare professionals in the United States.
            It includes over 99% of the approximately 1.1M doctors practicing
            medicine in the Unites States and over 6.5M key influencers
            including pharmacists, registered nurses, mental health
            professionals, hospital executives, payers and more.
          </p>
          <h3>Delivering ads across devices:</h3>
          <p>
            Adfire Health utilizes a comprehensive identity graph that includes
            over 25M devices and over 128M persistent identifiers so that we can
            enhance personalization by displaying ads across devices, households
            and locations.
          </p>
          <h3>Segmenting data to enable actionable analytics:</h3>
          <p>
            By segmenting our healthcare professional data by specialty (we
            targeted PCPs, NPs and PA’s) and prescribing behavior (those who
            prescribed high doses at high volume; high doses at low volume; low
            doses at high volume; and low doses at low volume), Adfire Health
            was able to better understand the behavior of the users who clicked
            through the ads and optimize campaign results.
          </p>
          <h3>Optimizing ad performance with programmatic technology:</h3>
          <p>
            Adfire Health optimized ad performance by continuously analyzing
            campaign trends to determine which factors were increasing
            performance (i.e. ad placement, devices targeted and timing) and
            adjusting them accordingly.
          </p>
          <h3>Retargeting healthcare professionals most likely to convert:</h3>
          <p>
            On average, only 2% of web traffic converts on the first visit, so
            it’s important to continuously place your ads in front of the 98% of
            users who don’t convert immediately. By tracking healthcare
            professionals who clicked on our client’s advertisements originally,
            Adfire Health created a more targeted list of healthcare
            professionals who showed interested in this branded Rx and
            continuously displayed ads in front of them.

            Our digital ad campaign with Adfire Health was so successful that we
            decided to continue selling our prescription for an additional five
            years when we planned on stopping sales’ efforts because a generic
            version of this prescription was coming on the market.
