            This is a theoretical case study I am working on as part of my

            progress so if you see some random lorem ipsum or if it seems
            incomplete, please don't judge it too harshly!

            <p>
              The overwhelming consensus amongst our site's users is that they
              often hesistant to choose our establishment due to a lack of
              transparency. This is not a trust issue, but more that they find
              it difficult to have their questions answered when they are
              choosing a restaurant.

              Tilly is an older college professor who needs to be able to see
              the nutritional facts and ingredients for different menu items
              because he has dietary restrictions and also has certain items she
              like would like to avoid.

              Gerald is a recent Houstonian transplant who nees to see what a
              restaurants parking situation and atmosphere are like ahead of
              time because he is new to the area is does not know what the
              different parts of town are like, and therefore doesnâ€™t know how
              the vibe of the different restaurants there will be like.

            <p>
              Since the biggest problem our customers face is finding answers to
              their questions, the solution seems obvious. Give them the
              answers! More specifically, the proposed solution is to present
              answers at points of the user journey when the questions would
              initially arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can be done by adding various pages and pop ups to our site.
              Expaning our 'About Us' section to include images and layouts of
              the restaurant would go a long way in helping Gerald, and pop ups
              in our menus would help put Tilly at ease.
